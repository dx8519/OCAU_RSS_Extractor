I have a dead H100i for parts if anyone wants it.  I&#039;ve salvaged the fans from it, but the rest is available (no AMD mounts).  The cause of death was that one of the tubes popped off where it connects to the radiator.  Before this occurred it was not cooling properly and i suspect there may have been some air in the loop (there is certainly more now).<br />

I bought from Umart on the GC late last year and had the first one I got replaced with another with less backlight bleed, so it&#039;s about as good as you can get from this model (I&#039;m very picky about this and apart from some very minor bleed in one corner it&#039;s perfect).<br />
