I have a dead H100i for parts if anyone wants it.  I&#039;ve salvaged the fans from it, but the rest is available (no AMD mounts).  The cause of death was that one of the tubes popped off where it connects to the radiator.  Before this occurred it was not cooling properly and i suspect there may have been some air in the loop (there is certainly more now).<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hi all,<br />
<br />
Looking to either do a swap on a PG279Q for an ultrawide + some cash or sell it and buy one outright.<br />
<br />
I bought from Umart on the GC late last year and had the first one I got replaced with another with less backlight bleed, so it&#039;s about as good as you can get from this model (I&#039;m very picky about this and apart from some very minor bleed in one corner it&#039;s perfect).<br />
<br />
Have the box and everything included + receipt.<br />
<br />
<b>R: $750<br />
</b><br />
Feel free to shoot me a PM if you have an X34 or...<br />
<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hey all,<br />
<br />
Selling my <a href="https://www.pccasegear.com/products/40062/ek-full-cover-water-block-radeon-vega-acetal-nickel" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">EK Full Cover Water Block Radeon Vega Acetal/Nickel</a> as I need to use an Alphacool Eiswolf GPX Pro for my new set-up (integrated pump) so have no use for this.<br />
<br />
Never used for longer than 2 hours of leak testing.<br />
I think it was filled once bu the system was having issues with the CPU so I had to take it apart and I ended up putting the stock cooler back on.<br />
<br />
Have all...<br />
