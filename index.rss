<br />
We have had a mac mini that gets used for email and internet. Recently we found it was getting hot and the fan had died. I replaced the fan, but still no joy, I suspect the logic board header for the fan has fried.<br />
<br />
It comes with 16Gb of ram however the HDD has been removed to go in to a new mac mini. <br />
<br />
With a HDD, it will power on fine and sit around 50 degrees browsing and youtube, playing minecraft it hit 90 :/<br />
<br />
Asking $150 as I dont have the time to spend watercooling it or...<br />
